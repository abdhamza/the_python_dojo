# Python Practice Questions and Solutions

Welcome to our Python Practice Questions and Solutions repository! This resource is designed for students who are eager to sharpen their Python programming skills through hands-on practice. Each topic is carefully curated to enhance your understanding of Python, from the basics to more advanced concepts.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized topic-wise, allowing you to focus on specific areas of interest or challenge. Here's how it's structured:

- **Basics**: Start here if you're new to Python or programming in general. Topics include variables, data types, and basic I/O operations.
- **Control Structures**: Dive into conditional statements and loops to control the flow of your Python programs.
- **Functions and Modules**: Learn how to write reusable pieces of code with functions and understand how to organize your projects with modules.
- **Data Structures**: Explore Python's built-in data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Understand classes, objects, inheritance, and more to write structured and efficient code.
- **Error Handling**: Learn how to make your programs more robust by handling exceptions gracefully.
- **File Handling**: Practice reading from and writing to files to handle data persistence in your applications.
- **Advanced Topics**: Challenge yourself with more complex topics, including decorators, generators, and comprehensions.

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Choose a Topic**: Navigate to the topic you're currently learning or want to practice.
2. **Attempt the Questions**: Each topic folder contains solution of their respective questions. Try to solve them on your own first.
3. **Check the Solutions**: If you're stuck or want to compare your solution, look into the `solutions` subfolder within each topic directory.

# Python Topic wise Questions

Solve the following Python challenges by yourself. If you need help, the solutions are available in this repository. Good luck and have fun coding!

## Variables
### 1) Variable Assignment
Assign the value 5 to a variable and then copy that value to another variable before printing it, how would you write a Python code to achieve this? 
Your solution should involve creating two variables and ensuring the second variable displays the same value as the first when printed.

### 2) Data Types
What data type is the variable z if z = 3.5? write code to print type of z.
Hint: The output should look something like "The value of z is 3.5 and type of z is float"

### 3) Type Conversion
Given x = "123", convert x to an integer.

### 4) Combining Strings
How do you combine the strings str1 = "Hello" and str2 = "World" to print out "Hello World"?

### 5) Basic Arithmetic
Given two variables a = 10 and b = 20, how do you calculate their sum and print it?

### 6) Basic Arithmetic
Given two variables a = 10 and b = 20, how do you calculate their product and print it?

### 7) Swapping Variables
How can you swap the values of two variables a = 5 and b = 10?

### 8) String Repetition
Given a string variable str = "Hi!", how do you print this string 3 times in a row?

### 9) Float Precision
Given a = 3.14159265, how do you print a with only two decimal places?

### 10) Multiple Assignments
How can you assign the values 1, 2, and 3 to variables a, b, and c in a single line?

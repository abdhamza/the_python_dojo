'''Question 1: Variable Assignment
Assign the value 5 to a variable and then copy that value to another variable before printing it, how would you write a Python code to achieve this? 
Your solution should involve creating two variables and ensuring the second variable displays the same value as the first when printed.'''

x = 5
y = x
print(y)
print(x)

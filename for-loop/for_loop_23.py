'''Question 23: Placeholder for Future Code
Suppose you're planning to write a for loop that will process items in a list, but you're not ready to implement the processing code yet. Write the loop structure with a pass statement as a placeholder.'''

items = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for item in items:
    pass  # Placeholder for future processing code
